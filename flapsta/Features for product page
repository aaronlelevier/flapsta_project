Disclaimer: Please note that while Flapsta is adhesive to some materials, they are not intended to permanently stick your phone to flat surfaces over multiple hours or days. The time period that your phone will stick to windows/mirrors etc. largely depends on the composition, cleanliness and smoothness of the specific object you stick your phone onto. Flapsta therefore cannot warrant certain minimum time periods for which your phone will stick to individual surfaces.
